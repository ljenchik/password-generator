# Password Generator

## Overview

An application which generates a random password based on criteria provided by the user. The user enters the length of a password and is able to choose all or none of four options: lower case letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

In case the entered length of a password was not an integer between 10 and 64, the user will be notified in alert and prompted to enter a correct integer.
